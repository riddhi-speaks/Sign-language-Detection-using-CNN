## Project: Sign Language Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks

**Abstract:**

This project aims to develop a sign language recognition model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. By building this model, we will gain insights into how CNNs learn to recognize patterns in images, specifically hand shapes and poses for sign language. The trained model can potentially bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing individuals by translating signs into text or spoken language. 

**Objectives:**

1. **Preprocess CSV data:** Convert sign language image pixel data from the CSV file into a usable format for the CNN.
2. **Reshape data:** Reshape the preprocessed data into a consistent format (e.g., 28x28 pixels, grayscale) suitable for the CNN's input layer.
3. **Implement CNN architecture:** Build a CNN model following the provided code structure, which utilizes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions to learn features from the images.
4. **Train the model:** Train the CNN model on the preprocessed sign language image data, allowing it to learn the relationships between features and specific sign language gestures.

These objectives will contribute to understanding CNNs for pattern recognition and their potential applications in real-world scenarios like sign language recognition, promoting inclusivity and communication accessibility.
